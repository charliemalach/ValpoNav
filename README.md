# ValpoNav
CS-495 Independent Study

At Valparaiso University, students face many obstacles, but the least of a student's worries should be navigation. 
Navigating a new campus can be confusing, and challenging for both first year students and upperclassmen. 
Even visitors may have a hard time navigating the campus environment. In response to this issue, we 
have decided to develop a navigation application that has an interactive campus map and allows 
users to locate buildings and their existing rooms with the corresponding room number. 
This website will be able to be utilized by any student, staff, or visitor which 
would eliminate the confusion and worries. This software has been developed in 
HTML/CSS for the user interfaces which utilize PHP, Javascript, and React.js 
for functional purposes and database management for our software.
