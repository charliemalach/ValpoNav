## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

A team from Computing and Information Sciences (CIS) undertook to build a responsive web centered campus information mapping application as an independent study with Professor Nicholas S. Rosasco, DSc. This application would assist in navigation issues on campus and include information about the interior layouts for various buildings on campus. The CIS team opted for the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure that the application is fast, reliable, and easy to maintain. The responsive design of the application ensures that it is optimized for use on a variety of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The CIS team also utilized the Leaflet.js Javascript library, as it is the leading open-source library which enables interactive maps that are also mobile friendly. The team worked closely together to define and prioritize the application's features, and then broke them down into smaller, manageable pieces of work called user stories, which were then prioritized and scheduled for development in short sprints, usually lasting one week. These choices enabled the system to be built in an “agile driven” collaborative approach, while still incorporating new innovations and ideas. Within the responsive application, users are able to search for specific buildings with autocompleting search functionality, or by browsing the organized ‘Navigation Menu’. The information provided for each building includes its name, description, and relevant photos. Extra features include a view change between Satellite and Map view, Current Geo location view, magnifying zoom functionality, and a reset view for the center of campus.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Usage

This application can be used to find and locate buildings both on and off campus. There are color coded markers grouped by building type, making it easier for users to navigate the campus map. Users can find markers by:

- Moving around the map themselves
- Using the Navigation Menu on the sidebar
- Searching for the name of a building with the search bar.

After finding the desired building, users are able to view inside to find more details about the building, including:

- An image of the building
- A brief description of the building
- A link to the floorplans for the building

The goal of the developers was to make an application that was easy to use, mobile friendly, and packed with useful information for those looking to navigate campus.
